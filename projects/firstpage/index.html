    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hiya! If you want me to love you, get me <b>a good book</b> that gets me hooked. In return, I'll cook your favourite meal, just give me a couple of tries if it's the first time I hear about it! </p>
    <p>I consider myself to be a resolute student. And resolute or not, I will always be a student. I love learning new stuff, from languages to computing, self improvement, you name it.</p>
    <p>I try to keep it simple, fair actions. I understand mistakes and I understand the meaning of second chances. What I do not is wickedness and meanness. Aye, we'll get rid of it eventually ;) </p>

    <h3>Name and Origins</h3>
    <p>I am a originally from <b>Barcelona</b>, Spain. I lived in several countries including Germany and I currently live in the UK (mae lovely Edinbrah!).</p>
    <p>My name? Willem. It's written differently but no one pronounces it correctly outside eastern Spain. People end up pronouncing it in so many ways that I made it easy, I changed the first letters (Gu for W) and I ended up liking the result. Willem! You won't believe it but I've been called “Golum” (wtf) twice in my life... Yeah, I wonder if my name actually had anything to do with it. You can laugh now.</p>
